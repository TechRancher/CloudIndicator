.Description of the project
This project uses a servo, and a photoresistor. The photoresistor will read the resistance from the 
light in the area where the photoresitor is located. Then with some math we convert that into 
analog data to control the servo. We will use the library Servo.h to help with the analog data sent
to the servo. What you need to do first after building the circuit is to test your photorestor values
in the area where it is placed. Say, like my work bench with overhead lighting. My values I got for
bright light is 32 resistance value, and with lights off 1006 resistance value. Remember voltage 
drops as light drops, but resistance increases through the photoresistor. That is why we read higher
resistance values when the light is off. Now we record this value into a valiable to use with math.
We will use Line Slope math then use Point Slope math to get to our equation to tell the IC to adjust
the servo to the right degree. What we want is the servo to move from 0*(degree) to 180*(degree) based
off the photoresistor value. So, with the Point Slope equation we can do this. For the math involved
look up how to do line slope and point slope equations.

.Items Needed
* One Photoresistor buttons
* One 5K Ohm Resistor
* One servo motor
* One servo motor arm to help you see the servo moving
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Eight jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed the 10K Ohm resistor left leg to column 26, and the right leg to column 30.
The left leg of the photoresistor to column 30, and the right leg to column 32. Now, for the servo. There
are 3 wires coming form the servo. Brown, Red, Orange and here is how to wire them up. The brown is GND, so
run a jumper wire from the breadboard GND to the brown connector. The red wire on the server is 5V power,
so run a jumper wire from the breadboard positive rail to the red connector on the servo. And the orange
wire is signal wire, run a jumper wire from pin 11 on the Ardunio to the orange connector. We need to now
run 5V power from the Arduino to the positive rail on the breadboard. Run a jumper wire from the GND on the
Arduino to the GND rail on the breadboard. Run a jumper wire from pin A0 to column 30. Run a jumper wire
from GND rail to column 32. Then run a jumper wire from the 5V rail to column 26. The circuit is now wired up.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "CloudIndicator.ino".

.What To Expect
This project will take reading from the photoresistor and through our Point Slope equation we will make the 
servo move. Now, when you move your hand over the photoresistor the servo will move in responds to the 
resistance through the photoresistor. So, when the light in the area of the photoresistor is less, the servo
will move to indicate the increase in resistance. Same as when the light in the area of the photoresistor 
increases, the servo will more to indicate the decrease in resistance through the photoresistor. Have fun with
this. Brainstorm and think of ways how to use this in a project.
